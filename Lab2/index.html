        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="big-html">HTML</span>) </strong>is the standard markup language for creating web pages and
            web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web browsers receive <span class="big-html">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. <span class="big-html">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for the appearance of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of <span class="big-html">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="big-html">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="big-html">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured
            documents
            by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other
            items.
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="html_el">&lt;img/&gt</span> and <span class="html_el">&lt;input /></span> directly introduce content into the page. Other
            tags such as <span class="html_el">&lt;p /></span> surround and provide information about document text and
            may
            include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span class="big-html">HTML</span> tags, but use them to interpret the
            content
            of the page.</p>
            <hr>
        <h2>Markup</h2>
        <p><span class="big-html">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called <em>tags</em> (and their <em>attributes</em>), character-based <em>data types, character references</em> and <em>entity references.</em>  <span class="big-html">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class="html_el">&lth1></span> and <span class="html_el">&lt/h1> </span>, although some represent <em>empty elements</em> and so are unpaired, for example <span class="html_el">&ltimg></span>. The first tag in such a pair is the <em>start tag,</em> and the second is the <em>end tag</em> (they are also called <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>).</p>
        <p>Another important component is the <span class="big-html">HTML</span> <em>document type declaration</em>, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
        <p> The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
        <pre><code class="html_el"> 
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
            &lt;html&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;<span class="text-in-code">This is a title</span>&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;<span class="text-in-code">Hello world!</span>&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
